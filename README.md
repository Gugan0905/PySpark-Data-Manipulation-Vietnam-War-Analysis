# PySpark-Data-Manipulation-Vietnam-War-Analysis

This repository contains the notebooks I used for my Data management and Processing course. In this task, I employed the PySpark library to create a Spark session for a more efficient analysis of the Vietnam War dataset. (Json dataset available in repo)
To further support the improvements of Spark Library, I compare the efficiency of some sub tasks using the PySpark sytax, dataframe syntax and RDD operation syntax.
